    <title>Interactive SPA: PCA Proof of Traction Dashboard</title>

    <!-- Placeholder Comments -->
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Subtle Gold & Slate -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A tabbed dashboard interface. This structure is superior to a static document because it allows non-linear exploration. Users can immediately see high-level KPIs on the default "Dashboard" tab, dive into the narrative on the "Case Studies" tab, or review social proof on the "Qualitative" tab. This user-driven flow is more engaging for demonstrating traction. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Performance KPIs: Goal(Inform/Impress) -> Large Stat Cards & an Interactive HTML Table -> Justification(Cards provide instant "wow" factor, while the sortable/filterable table demonstrates depth and consistency).
        - Case Studies: Goal(Explain) -> Two-column layout with a narrative and a Chart.js Canvas chart -> Justification(Separates the story from the visual result for easy digestion; the chart visualizes the success).
        - Testimonials: Goal(Social Proof) -> Filterable cards -> Justification(Allows users to find testimonials relevant to their specific interests, like "Clarity" or "ROI").
